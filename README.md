# M.E.R.N. Authentication Boilerplate
Full Stack Project starter with basic components routes and authentication. The project is in MVC format that includes the User model and controller. The first routes in the client are protected by the passport authentication using the local strategy. 

## Purpose and Inspiration
You can fork and run this to quickly have an MVC project up and running, then simply add the controllers models and components that your project needs. I wanted to have a place to start with no other models than the User model. This is currently at the point where you can:

- Register a new user
- Login with an existing user
- Log Out
*(You are not able to navigate to client side routes that are protected by authentication)*


## MVC
This project is structured in Full Stack Javascript with Mongoose Models REACT Views and Controllers. The heavy lifting for the authentication is done in src/utils/Auth.js.
